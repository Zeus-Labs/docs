<Accordion title="The `git clone` command is not working.">
Try to git clone with both SSH and HTTPS formats. Here are the two commands to try:
```bash Bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Zeus-Labs/ZeusCloud.git
```
```bash Bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Zeus-Labs/ZeusCloud.git
```

<Accordion title="Error when deploying: `docker.errors.DockerException`">
  Docker may not be running on your system, and you may need to restart it.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Error when deploying: `Cannot start service proxy: Ports are not available`">
  Make sure port 80 is not occupied by other projects / containers / etc.

<Accordion title="Error when deploying: `Invalid memory configuration - exceeds physical memory`">
  If deploying ZeusCloud doesn't work, you may find a neo4j container log stating `Invalid memory configuration - exceeds physical memory`.

  This happens if ZeusCloud requires more memory than available on Docker Desktop. Some fixes include
  - Increase the memory allocated to Docker Desktop. The default is usally 2 GB. Here's some <a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/">documentation</a> on increasing memory allocated.
  - Reduce the memory used by ZeusCloud. In the <a href="https://github.com/Zeus-Labs/ZeusCloud/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml">`docker-compose.yaml` file</a>, reduce the values of `NEO4J_dbms_memory_pagecache_size`, `NEO4J_dbms.memory.heap.initial_size`, and `NEO4J_dbms_memory_heap_max__size`. The default values are `250m`.
  - Delete existing containers, images, and volumes to make room for ZeusCloud.
