title: "Attack Paths"
---

Attack paths are toxic combinations of risks in your environment. By chaining these risks together, an attacker may execute an exploit.

Some components of an attack path may include 
- <b>Publicly facing assets</b>: an attacker may get initial access to your environment through publicly exposed VMs, containers, or serverless functions.
- <b>3rd party identities</b>: Adversaries may attack external 3rd party entities to whom you have given privileges in your account.
- <b>Admin or high privileged principals</b>: A takeover of these IAM principals may lead to data access or account takeover.
- <b>Privilege escalations</b>: Certain combinations of privileges (e.g. `iam:PassRole` and `ec2:RunInstances`) may allow an attacker to subtly escalate their priveleges within your account. More details about privilege escalations can be found <a href="https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/aws-privilege-escalation-methods-mitigation/">here</a>.
