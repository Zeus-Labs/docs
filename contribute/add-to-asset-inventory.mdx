We're super grateful for Lyft's <a href="https://github.com/lyft/cartography">cartography</a> project, which ZeusCloud uses as its underlying cloud asset inventory.

You can add or update cloud assets in ZeusCloud's <a href="https://github.com/Zeus-Labs/cartography">fork of cartography</a>. An example where we add EC2 Instance Profiles to the asset inventory can be found <a href="https://github.com/Zeus-Labs/cartography/pull/20/files">here</a>.
