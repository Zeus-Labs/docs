Head over to the `Alerts` page to see the results of ZeusCloud security rules. For each rule, ZeusCloud shows you alerts associated with that rule and whether the alert passed or failed.

You can search by rule name; filter by attributes like severity, type of risk, cloud account, mute status, and alert status; and sort by severity or # of alerts.

For each alert, you're given context as to why the alert passed or failed. Furthermore, click on the `i` icon to get further information like remdediation steps!
