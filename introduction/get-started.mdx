Deploy ZeusCloud locally and scan your AWS account(s)! If you run into any issues, check out our <a href="../community_and_support/troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> guide.

<h2>Prepare AWS Credentials</h2>

Your ZeusCloud deployment will need AWS credentials to scan your account(s). Either set up an IAM role for ZeusCloud or set up an IAM user with an access key. The former uses short-term credentials, which is more secure! However, it can take a bit more time to setup. 

<Accordion title="Option 1: IAM role (more secure)">

<Note>

<b>Prerequisite:</b> An existing named profile in `~/.aws/config`. ZeusCloud will request credentials for the IAM role via this named profile. 

If you have no such named profile, either
- Create an IAM user with no permissions, create an access key for it, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html">create a named profile</a> in `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/credentials`.
- Try Option 2 below instead.

</Note>

The steps to set up the IAM role are
1. Create a new IAM role in the account.
2. Attach the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html#jf_security-auditor">SecurityAudit</a> policy to it.
3. Create a trust relationship policy allowing the user/role associated with the above named profile to assume this role. Here's a template:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Statement1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": <INSERT_USER_ARN_ASSOCIATED_WITH_NAMED_PROFILE>
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```
4. Create a named profile in `~/.aws/config` for this new IAM role. Here's a template:
```
[profile zeuscloud]
region=us-west-2
role_arn=<INSERT_NEWLY_CREATED_ROLE_ARN>
source_profile=<INSERT_NAMED_PROFILE_THAT_ASSUMES_ROLE>
```

<Note>You must set a region in this named profile for ZeusCloud to successfully scan!</Note>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Option 2: IAM user + access key (faster)">

<div style={{position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '64.63195691202873%', height: 0}}><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/679c67bf656c4fa785e44b6dc8d82e55" frameBorder={0} webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen style={{position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%'}} /></div>

The steps to set up the IAM user and access key are

1. Create a new IAM user in the account.

2. Attach the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html#jf_security-auditor">SecurityAudit</a> policy to the user.

3. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html">Create an access key</a> for the user.

<Warning>

Access keys are long-term credentials. Be sure to delete the user / access key once they are no longer needed!

</Warning>

<h2>Deploy ZeusCloud Locally</h2>

#### 1. Clone the repo.
```bash Bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Zeus-Labs/ZeusCloud.git
```
#### 2. Run ZeusCloud.
```bash Bash
cd ZeusCloud
make quick-deploy
```

<Note>

If you are not deploying locally (on an AWS VM, for instance), you will need to change the `WEBSITE_DOMAIN` and `REACT_APP_API_DOMAIN` environment variables in the `.env` file before deploying. Examples are `http://<your-vm-ip>:80` or `https://<your-deployed-domain>:443`.

</Note>

<Note>

If you are deploying with Option 1, ZeusCloud expects your AWS configurations in `~/.aws`. If your configurations are in a different location, update the `AWS_DIRECTORY` variable in the `.env` file. For Windows, change to `%USERPROFILE%\.aws`.

</Note>

#### 3. Visit UI
Visit http://localhost:80.


<h2>Connect ZeusCloud to AWS</h2>

Once ZeusCloud is deployed, you must connect it to the AWS account(s) you would like to scan. Navigate to `Settings > Add new account`. Fill in the `Account Name` with whatever string-identifier you would like. Fill in remaining fields based on whether you are deploying with Option 1 or 2.

<Accordion title="Option 1: IAM role">

1. Select `Named Profile` for `Connection Method`.
2. In the `Profile` dropdown, select the named profile you created earlier.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Option 2: IAM user + access key">

1. Select `User Access Key` for `Connection Method`.
2. Fill in the `AWS Access Key ID` and `AWS Secret Access Key` with the access key credentials you just created.
3. Optionally, change the default region.

</Accordion>


<h2>Wait for Scan </h2>

Once you connect your account(s), ZeusCloud will scan them and run various security rules. 

This process may take 10-15 minutes. 
- Monitor progress through the UI: the `Settings` page should show a percentage completed.
- Monitor the terminal as well: you should see logs from the `cartography` container.

You should see `backend` container logs like above if the scan has successfully completed.

<h2> Explore ZeusCloud Findings </h2>

At the end of the scan, navigate to the `Alerts` tab to see findings for misconfiguration and attack path security rules. 

Check out the `Rules` tab for a catalog of the security rules that were run. Check your compliance posture for various frameworks in the `Compliance` tab.
