## Local Deploy

Deploy ZeusCloud locally or on a VM not exposed to the internet.

#### 1. Clone the repo.
```bash Bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Zeus-Labs/ZeusCloud.git
```
#### 2. Run ZeusCloud.
```bash Bash
cd ZeusCloud
make quick-deploy
```
#### 3. Visit UI
Visit http://localhost:3000.


<h2>Connect and Scan</h2>

#### 1. Connect your AWS accounts. 
Navigate to `Settings > Add new account`. You will be asked to fill in credentials for the AWS account you would like to scan.

To do so, create a new IAM user in the account. Attach the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html#jf_security-auditor">Security Audit</a> policy to the user. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html">Create an access key</a> for the user.

Fill in the `Account Name` with whatever identifier you would like. Fill in the `AWS Access Key ID` and `AWS Secret Access Key` you just created. Optionally, change the default region.

We will soon be adding additional ways for ZeusCloud to connect to your AWS account (e.g. through IAM roles).

#### 2. Wait for ZeusCloud to scan. 

Once you connect your account(s), ZeusCloud will scan them and run various security rules. The `Scan Status` should read `In Progress` for your added account. This process may take 10-15 minutes. Reference the docker compose logs to check if progress is being made.

## Explore ZeusCloud findings

At the end of the scan, ZeusCloud rules will be run. Check out the `Rules` tab for a catalog of the security rules. Navigate to the `Alerts` tab to see findings for misconfiguration and attack path rules. Check your compliance posture for various frameworks in the `Compliance` tab.
