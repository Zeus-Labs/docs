## Why ZeusCloud?
Cloud usage continues to grow. Companies are shifting more of their workloads from on-prem to the cloud and both adding and expanding new and existing workloads in the cloud. Cloud providers keep increasing their offerings and their complexity. Companies are having trouble keeping track of their security risks as their cloud environment scales and grows more complex. Several high profile attacks have occurred in recent times. Capital One had an S3 bucket breached, Amazon had an unprotected Prime Video server breached, Microsoft had an Azure DevOps server breached, Puma was the victim of ransomware, etc.

We had to take action.

- We noticed traditional cloud security tools are opaque, confusing, time consuming to set up, and expensive as you scale your cloud environment
- Cybersecurity vendors don't provide much actionable information to security, engineering, and devops teams by inundating them with non-contextual alerts
- ZeusCloud is easy to set up, transparent, and configurable, so you can prioritize the most important risks 
- Best of all, you can use **ZeusCloud for free**!
